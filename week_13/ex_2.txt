1)If we haven't got info in advance:
	avoidance is useless
	recovery takes quite a lot of time (overall). 
		preemption is the best way in recovery, but we can't always take a resource from a proccess without noticing, so it's not always reliable
		rollback takes additional space (the only one in recovery) so isn't reliable if we are out of space (or have a few)
		killing proccess is actually the worse way of dealing with deadlock as some already produced info might be used or it will fail a real time system
	prevention IS THE BEST APPROACH HERE
		Mutual ex will work good even if we don't have a lot of space 
		Hold and Wait and no preemption can take more time, but won't crush real time system
		Circular wait is the best one (if we have some add space)
2)If we have got info in advance
	avoidance IS THE BEST APPROACH HERE (as is the most reliable and quite fast)
	recovery takes more time
	prevention is good enough
3)If the hardware can run only few proccesses at one time (old machines, around 2-3 proc.)
	recovery IS THE BEST APPROACH HERE (as it is easy to implement and we don't really need the complicated deadlock dealer)
